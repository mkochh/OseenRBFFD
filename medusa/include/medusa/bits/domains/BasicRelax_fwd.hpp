/**
 * Redistributes nodes towards more uniform distribution by minimizing potential between nodes. The
 * engine first finds `num_neighbours` closest neighbours. Then it translates each point according
 * to the repelling "force" induced by its neighbours, where it also takes into account target
 * potential. The force is determined by summing the gradients of potentials in surrounding nodes,
 * where amplitude is determined based on distance to the closest neighbour and supplied target
 * density function. The algorithm uses also a primitive Simulated Annealing, i.e.\ the relax
 * movement magnitude is multiplied with an annealing factor that is linearly dropping from
 * initial_heat to final_heat.
 *
 * The Engine supports two call types: with supplied distribution function relax(func), where it
 * tries to satisfy the user supplied nodal density function. This can be achieved only when there
 * is the total number of domain nodes the same as integral of density function over the domain. If
 * there is too much nodes a volatile relax might occur. If there is not enough nodes the relax
 * might become lazy. The best use of this mode is in combination with fillDistribution Engines,
 * check test for examples.
 *
 * Without distribution, where nodes always move towards less populated area regardless anything.
 * The relax magnitude is simply determined from annealing factor and distance to the closest node.
 * A simple and stable approach, however, note that this relax always converges towards uniformly
 * distributed nodes.
 *
 * Usage example:
 * @snippet domains/BasicRelax_test.cpp BasicRelax usage example
 * @ingroup domains
